# HIST-3812-Portfolio #

## Introduction ##

When I was younger, my love of history was reserved for the great stories, the epics about heroes, villians and the conflicts that they had throughout our species' existance. I loved to learn about the mythos of greek society, the lives of those in the trenches and the great european explorers that travelled across the pacific. As I grew older I learned more about how history and more specifically these stories were shaped by those who had the ability to record their side of the story, and how decisions in government influenced the history that was worth telling. When I came to university I wanted to explore the stories that are not told and find new ways to help share these stories and help demonstrate the morally grey nature of human history. Throughout this course, we have explored how digital tools can be used to help share these stories, and how history is presented impacts that themes and emotions it represents and emphasises. This portfolio will explore the various modules that we coverd, and provide a small description of the lessons learned along the way. 

## Module 1: Physical to Digital Copies ##

In the first module, we took phyiscal objects and found ways to digitize them. In class, our professor talked about 3d printed artifacts and brought up questions involving htier authenticity and their ability to portray the themes of an artifact and truely established the question of "What makes something original." (Find more reading on this: [here](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/66) & [here](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/benjamin.pdf)) This discussion was crucial to me understanding how digital history was different then the history I had dealt with in the past, we were spending more time discussing the themes and ideas that were brought forward when we transitioned artifacts from the physical to the digital. The artifact that I made, a [broken model of the head of Louise McKinney](https://github.com/Robert-Oles/hist3812-Photogrammetry-) taught me about the importance of failure, and how despite the fact that the model was completely garbage, the fact that I created it, and interacted with the artifact in a new way provided so many opportunities to engage deeper into Louise McKinney as a person rather than just as a member of the Famous Five. The horrific model also reminded me of a monster, lead me to try to explore the darker themes of Louise McKinney in the rest of the modules.

## Module 2: Digital Copies to Digital Things ##

In the second module, we took our digital artifacts and tried to find compelling ways with which we could present our artifact in a new way while still being truefull to the source in order to demonstrate something new. Our professor provided us with an awesome example at the start of this module in the form of [Scary Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T5_0AGdFic) a recut version of the Mary Poppins trailer that through remixing the content, paints Mary Poppins as the villian of a horror movie. With this in mind I tackled mixing the model I had created in module one with a model of [AMG Mercedes Car](https://sketchfab.com/models/b228ceebe428474083ab96407e62a6c1) into a [Frankenstien-esc creation](https://sketchfab.com/models/c4e79a9dbcc24287bbf011737b3aefa4). Once again, I tried to find something that worked for the assignment and while doing so looked deeper with the actual target. I learned about Mercedes past, which made me want to create something that again highlighted the [the morally grey background of the both Mercedes and Louise McKinney](https://github.com/Robert-Oles/Hist3812-Module3/tree/master/Object%20Biography). This was by far my favorite module, finding compelling ways to mix two artifacts together was a tonne of fun and I believe best embodied what the course was about.
