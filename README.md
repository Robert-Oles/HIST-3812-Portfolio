# HIST-3812-Portfolio #

## Introduction ##

When I was younger, my love of history was reserved for the great stories, the epics about heroes, villians and the conflicts that they had throughout our species' existance. I loved to learn about the mythos of greek society, the lives of those in the trenches and the great european explorers that travelled across the pacific. As I grew older I learned more about how history and more specifically these stories were shaped by those who had the ability to record their side of the story, and how decisions in government influenced the history that was worth telling. When I came to university I wanted to explore the stories that are not told and find new ways to help share these stories and help demonstrate the morally grey nature of human history. Throughout this course, we have explored how digital tools can be used to help share these stories, and how history is presented impacts that themes and emotions it represents and emphasises. This portfolio will explore the various modules that we coverd, and provide a small description of the lessons learned along the way. 

## Module 1: Physical to Digital Copies ##

In the first module, we took phyiscal objects and found ways to digitize them. In class, our professor talked about 3d printed artifacts and brought up questions involving htier authenticity and their ability to portray the themes of an artifact and truely established the question of "What makes something original."
